# web-development

This is meant for freelancers applying into #web-development on Gratify.

## Requirements:
Please build a web application implementing a calendar. It should utilize any public calendar apis available (we recommend fullcalendar.io).  The application should allow users to login and upload pictures (no other types of files) to each calendar event. These pictures should be specific to each user. The users should be able to login using FB. The freelancer can use whatever back-end/front-end technology s/heâ€™s familiar with, but please keep it simple and do not rewrite code that can be found elsewhere.

Please push your code to github so that our team may review.
